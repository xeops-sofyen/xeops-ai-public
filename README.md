## 🚀 What is XeOps?

**XeOps.ai** is an AI-powered offensive security platform that transforms vulnerability discovery into verified exploits automatically. Built for security professionals who need **speed**, **accuracy**, and **proof** — not just vulnerability reports.

### Why XeOps?

> Traditional security scanners find vulnerabilities. XeOps **proves** they're exploitable.

- **100x Faster** than manual penetration testing
- **60,000+ Exploit Templates** ready to deploy
- **Zero False Positives** with verified proof-of-concept
- **24/7 Autonomous** operation without human intervention

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Discovery Phase**
AI-powered scanners identify potential vulnerabilities across your entire attack surface, using both signature-based and behavioral analysis.

### 2️⃣ **Exploitation Phase**
Our AI generates custom exploits for each vulnerability, adapting payloads in real-time based on application responses.

### 3️⃣ **Validation Phase**
Every exploit is tested in a safe environment to confirm exploitability and document the full attack chain.
